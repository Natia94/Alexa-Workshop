# Alexa-Workshop
Alexa is a virtual assistant developed by Amazon :boom: <br>

Amazon’s Alexa-controlled Echo speaker is the first wireless speaker. Using nothing but the sound of your voice, you can play music, search the Web, create to-do and shopping lists, shop online, get instant weather reports, and control popular smart-home products—all while your smartphone stays in your pocket.

During the workshop we created a new skill. This kill randomly select a fact from the array and creates speech output.

Here are following facts about me {
* I hate my name but I love letter ‘N'
* I prefer coffee over tea"
* I think and overthink about almost everything. And I can easily spend countless hours doing nothing but thinking
* I tend to follow an alphabetical ordering when arranging things on my computer.
* I don’t give compliments unless I feel that you truly deserve it.
* I hate bullying and if you bully me or others then you’re simply giving me a chance to ignore you forever.
* My favorite font is “Georgia” 
* I can not live without the Internet or iphone.
* I don’t celebrate my birthdays as I think there are only two days that matters — a birthday and a death-day
* I find it extremely difficult to speak my mind
* I have a view/opinion about almost all things in life except when it comes to my hair cut. A hair salon is the only place where I sit quietly (as long as they want) without any expectations or requirement. But I hope to fix it pretty soon.
* I registered my first domain name in Octomber 2017.
* I sound rude until you get to know me. The problem is… I don’t know what’s rude and what’s not.
* I seek perfection in almost everything I do
* I talk too fast when I get super excited <br>
